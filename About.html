    <h3>Who I am?</h3>
    <pre>
        Hi!
        I am  Ganga Ghosh.
                I am a girl who was born in a nuclear family in a village.
        A girl who is always wishing normal life , became a housewife.
        But I am not a type of that much. I love being indipendent.
          "Freedom and Self Respect" is important to me. 
        This is more valuble to me...
